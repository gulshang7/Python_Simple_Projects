Here are the requirements:

 * 2 players should be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer).
 * The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move.
 * You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board.

## STEP BY STEP PROCESS:

### Step 1: 
Write a function that can print out a board. Set up your board as a list, where each index 1-9 corresponds with a number on a number pad, so you get a 3 by 3 board representation.

### Step 2: 
Write a function that can take in a player input and assign their marker as 'X' or 'O'. Think about using while loops to continually ask until you get a correct answer.

### Step 3: 
Write a function that takes in the board list object, a marker ('X' or 'O'), and a desired position (number 1-9) and assigns it to the board.

### Step 4: 
Write a function that takes in a board and checks to see if someone has won.

### Step 5: 
Write a function that uses the random module to randomly decide which player goes first. You may want to lookup random.randint() Return a string of which player went first.

### Step 6: 
Write a function that returns a boolean indicating whether a space on the board is freely available.

### Step 7: 
Write a function that checks if the board is full and returns a boolean value. True if full, False otherwise.

### Step 8:
Write a function that asks for a player's next position (as a number 1-9) and then uses the function from step 6 to check if its a free position. If it is, then return the position for later use.

### Step 9: 
Write a function that asks the player if they want to play again and returns a boolean True if they do want to play again.

### Step 10: 
Use while loops and the functions you've made to run the game!
