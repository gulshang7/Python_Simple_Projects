 Here are the requirements:
   
    1) You need to create a simple text-based BlackJack game
    2) The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer. The player can stand or hit.
    3) The player must be able to pick their betting amount. You need to track the player's total money.
    4) You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...
